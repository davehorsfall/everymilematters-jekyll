Suicide, particularly male suicide, is a growing problem in the UK, and around the world. The statistics are stark. 6721 people died by suicide in the UK in 2019. This was a significant increase from 2018, and one which appears to be driven by the male suicide rate. Suicide remains the UK’s biggest single killer of men under the age of 45. Worrying trends are also emerging among young people – in the UK, suicide rates amongst the young have been increasing in recent years and the suicide rate for young females is now at its highest on record. Whilst data for 2020 is still provisional, the trends show no sign of reversing and there is real concern regarding the longer-term impact of recent lockdowns on mental health issues of all kinds.

These are awful facts to face and each of the 6721 deaths carries its own devastating story, its own reverberations through families, friends and wider society. This is why we want to take on a challenge that represents every one of those individuals and, in the process, draw attention to an issue that needs more exposure and understanding.

We intend to run 6721 miles across 2021 – a mile for every suicide and every tragic story behind it.
