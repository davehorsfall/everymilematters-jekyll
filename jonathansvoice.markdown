[Jonathan's Voice](https://jonathansvoice.org.uk/) is a registered charity, established in 2017 following the suicide of [Jonathan McCartney](https://jonathansvoice.org.uk/about-jonathan).  Jon's death aged just 35 was a bolt out of the blue and the tragedy of his sudden passing has left deep and varied impressions on all those who knew him.

Everyone running as part of this project knew Jon personally and, while each of us brings his own individual motivations for participating, we all share a recognition of the significance of mental health issues and the importance of taking action to reduce the stigma still commonly associated with them.

Jonathan's Voice performs valuable work in supporting organisations and research in relation to mental health, with a particular emphasis on mental health in [professional environments](https://jonathansvoice.org.uk/present-initiatives).

This running project is intended to raise both money for, and awareness of, the work Jonathan's Voice undertakes and we encourage everyone to explore the [charity's website](https://jonathansvoice.org.uk/) and what the organisation has to offer.

Our hope is that, by increasing awareness of mental health issues, we can play a small part in stripping away the social stigma surrounding them and send out a clear message of support for organisations like Jonathanâ€™s Voice.
